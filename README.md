Hi, I'm Sarah aka. Scyras.
I work in Cyber Security as a consultant!
Some of the stuff I'm very interested in, is pentesting, red teaming, CTF's and coding.
Certs;
  - PJPT
  - CRTP (soon!)

Fun fact: I am pretty good at Mario Kart, I spend almost every morning in 2020 racing for a couple of hours to stay sane.
